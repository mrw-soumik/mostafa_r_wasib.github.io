# Mostafa Rafiur Wasib's AI and Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am an AI professional with a background in machine learning, data science, and reinforcement learning. Below, you’ll find an overview of my key projects and contributions.

## Featured Projects

### 1. [CO2 Emissions Prediction & Anomaly Detection](CO2_Emissions.md)
Developed an ensemble model for predicting CO2 emissions and optimized an LSTM-based anomaly detection system using AWS services. This project showcases my ability to work with time-series data, model tuning, and cloud-based deployment.

### 2. [Real-Time Visual to Audio Conversion for Accessibility](Visual_to_Audio.md)
Created a system that provides real-time audio descriptions of visual content for visually impaired users. This project uses a combination of image captioning and text-to-speech technologies to enhance accessibility on the web.

### 3. [Emotion Recognition System for HCI](Emotion_Recognition.md)
Built a multimodal emotion recognition system that detects facial expressions and voice emotions in real-time, improving human-computer interaction quality. The system uses computer vision and audio processing for enhanced user experience.

### 4. Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning Projects

### 5. [Fungal Habitat Prediction Using Taxonomy Data](Fungal_Habitat_Prediction.md)
Applied machine learning to predict fungal habitat types based on taxonomy and observation data, aiding ecological research and conservation efforts.

### 6. [Biological Sequence Classification via Data Encoding](Biological_Sequence_Classification.md)
Explored different data encoding methods for biological sequence classification, identifying k-mer encoding as the most effective approach for genomics applications.

### 7.  [Industrial Machine Vision - Facemask Detection System](Facemask_Detection.md)
Developed a facemask detection system using MATLAB's image processing tools, contributing to workplace safety by identifying mask compliance in real-time.

### 8. [Experiment with Learning Policies on Simple Reinforcement Policies](Reinforcement_Policies.md)
Implemented SARSA, Q-Learning, Monte Carlo, and TD(0) methods in a grid world environment, analyzing their effectiveness in policy learning and value estimation.

### 9. [Simple Bandit Learning Algorithms](Simple_Bandit_Algorithms.md)
Conducted experiments with bandit algorithms, including epsilon-greedy and optimistic initialization, to study exploration-exploitation trade-offs in reinforcement learning.

### 10. [Undergraduate Projects](Undergrad_Projects.md)
A collection of projects completed during my undergraduate studies, covering various AI topics like expert systems, natural language processing, and neural networks. Each project highlights foundational skills that set the stage for my advanced studies.
