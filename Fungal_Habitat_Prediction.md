# Fungal Habitat Prediction Using Taxonomic Classification and Observation Data

**Technologies:** Python, NumPy, scikit-learn, Random Forest  

## Objective
To predict fungal habitat types based on taxonomic classification and observation data, aiding in conservation efforts and understanding ecological patterns.

## Key Contributions
- Applied Random Forest algorithm to build a predictive model for fungal habitat classification.
- Conducted data preprocessing and feature selection to enhance model accuracy and generalizability.
- Analyzed model performance to identify strengths in predicting specific habitat types.

## Outcome
Achieved a moderate accuracy of 57.68%, demonstrating the model's utility in predicting certain habitat types such as 'coniferous woods' and 'other'. The project provides a foundation for future studies in ecological data and conservation.
