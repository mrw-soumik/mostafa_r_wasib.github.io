# Emotion Recognition System for Human-Computer Interaction

**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, Wav2Vec2, pre-trained CNNs  

## Objective
To create a comprehensive system for detecting emotions through facial expressions and voice in real-time, applicable in fields like customer service and healthcare.

## Key Contributions
- Developed facial expression recognition using pre-trained CNN models to identify emotions from facial data.
- Used Wav2Vec2 for real-time voice emotion detection, allowing multimodal recognition for enhanced accuracy.
- Integrated the system for practical applications in human-computer interaction, providing real-time emotional feedback.

## Outcome (Ongoing)
The project aims to improve user experience in human-computer interaction by accurately recognizing and responding to user emotions in real-time.
