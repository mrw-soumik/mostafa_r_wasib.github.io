# Image Processing: Edge Detection and Filtering in MATLAB

### Objective
To implement various image processing techniques to enhance image quality, remove noise, and highlight key features through edge detection and filtering.

### Technologies Used
- MATLAB
- Image Processing Toolbox

### Role and Contributions
- Developed and implemented MATLAB code to apply edge detection algorithms (Sobel, Prewitt, Canny, Laplacian of Gaussian, Roberts).
- Integrated Gaussian, median, and bilateral filters for effective noise reduction and image enhancement.
- Conducted comparative analysis of different edge detection methods and visualized the results.
- Documented the project and explained the processes for further use and exploration.

### Final Outcomes or Results
- Successfully demonstrated and visualized the impact of different filtering and edge detection techniques.
- Highlighted the strengths and limitations of each method in terms of noise handling and edge sharpness.
- Provided a comprehensive analysis that can be leveraged for future image processing projects and studies.
