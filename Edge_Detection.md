# Image Processing - Edge Detection and Filtering

**Technologies:** MATLAB  

## Objective
To implement various edge detection and filtering techniques to enhance image quality and highlight key features.

## Key Contributions
- Applied edge detection methods such as Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny to identify object boundaries in images.
- Used Gaussian and median filters to remove noise and improve image clarity.
- Visualized the results to compare the effectiveness of different edge detection and filtering techniques.

## Outcome
The project improved understanding of image processing fundamentals, demonstrating practical skills in edge detection and noise reduction.
