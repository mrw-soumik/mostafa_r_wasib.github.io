**Technologies:** Python, NLTK, TextRank  

## Objective
To build a text summarization tool that condenses lengthy documents into concise summaries, making information more accessible.

## Key Contributions
- Implemented an extractive text summarization algorithm based on TextRank, which identifies key sentences in a document.
- Preprocessed text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and calculating sentence similarity.
- Visualized sentence importance scores to illustrate the summary process.

## Outcome
The summarization tool successfully generated accurate summaries for news articles and academic papers, demonstrating the effectiveness of NLP in content summarization tasks.
