# Face, Gender, and Emotion Detection System for Retail Store

## Project Objective
The objective of this project was to develop a system capable of detecting customer faces, genders, and emotions in real-time to provide valuable insights for retail stores. This system aimed to help store managers analyze customer demographics and emotional responses, which could inform strategies for targeted customer engagement and improved service.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: OpenCV for computer vision tasks, facial detection, and emotion recognition algorithms
- **Environment**: Developed and tested on a local machine with a basic camera setup for real-time capture and processing

## Role and Contributions
This project was completed as my final year project for my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. I served as the primary developer and researcher, responsible for:
- Designing and implementing the face, gender, and emotion detection system from scratch
- Using OpenCV and pre-trained models to set up a real-time detection pipeline for capturing and analyzing facial features
- Developing and fine-tuning the algorithms to ensure reliable gender and emotion classification in diverse lighting conditions
- Testing the system on various datasets and real-time video feeds to evaluate performance and accuracy

## Final Outcomes
The project successfully resulted in a functional prototype that provided:
- **Real-Time Analysis**: The system could accurately detect and process faces, identify gender, and analyze emotions in real-time.
- **Retail Insights**: The system’s insights into customer demographics and emotional states offered valuable data for retail stores to adapt their marketing and engagement strategies based on customer responses.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved high accuracy rates in controlled settings, with room for further optimization for deployment in live retail environments.

## Key Takeaways
This project enhanced my skills in applying AI solutions to real-world challenges, particularly in computer vision, customer analysis, and real-time processing. It laid the foundation for my understanding of how AI can drive customer engagement and improve service quality in commercial settings.
