# Intelligent Robotics - Obstacle Avoidance System with Rovio Robot

**Technologies:** Rovio Robot, C++, OpenCV  

## Objective
To develop an obstacle avoidance system for the Rovio mobile robot, enabling it to navigate autonomously by recognizing and avoiding obstacles in its path.

## Key Contributions
- Programmed the Rovio robot using C++ to perform autonomous navigation by processing real-time input from its onboard camera.
- Used OpenCV for image processing tasks, including object detection and obstacle recognition. Circular markers were detected in the environment to guide the robot's movements.
- Implemented a path-planning algorithm that allowed the robot to detect obstacles and calculate alternate routes, using visual cues for decision-making.
- Calibrated the Rovioâ€™s camera to ensure accurate image capture and optimized sensor readings for smoother obstacle detection.

## Outcome
The Rovio robot successfully navigated an environment with obstacles, demonstrating an understanding of robotics, image processing, and obstacle avoidance techniques. This project showcased practical skills in using visual inputs to enhance autonomous navigation.
