# Machine Learning - Fuzzy Logic System for Weather Prediction

**Technologies:** MATLAB  

## Objective
To build a fuzzy logic system that predicts weather conditions based on inputs such as temperature, humidity, and wind.

## Key Contributions
- Defined fuzzy sets and rules to classify weather variables and make predictions on conditions like sunny, rainy, or cloudy.
- Implemented a fuzzy inference system in MATLAB, processing input data to produce predictions.
- Evaluated the accuracy of the predictions against actual weather data to assess the systemâ€™s reliability.

## Outcome
The fuzzy logic system provided reasonable weather predictions, illustrating the effectiveness of fuzzy systems in handling imprecise data.
