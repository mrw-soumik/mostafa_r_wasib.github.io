# DNA Sequence Classification via Data Encoding

**Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, Gradient Boosting

## Objective
To explore and determine the most effective data encoding method for classifying DNA sequences, aiming to enhance understanding and classification techniques in genomics research.

## Project Tasks and Contributions

This project was completed as a group of two, with tasks divided to efficiently explore various encoding techniques and evaluate their performance on DNA sequence classification.

### My Contributions:
- Conducted **data preprocessing and analysis** to prepare DNA sequences for model evaluation.
- Focused on **implementing and optimizing k-mer encoding** for sequence data, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
- Applied **Gradient Boosting Classifier** on k-mer encoded data to assess classification performance.
- Analyzed and documented the **impact of k-mer encoding** on classification accuracy and precision, identifying it as the most effective feature extraction method for this project.

### Partner's Contributions:
- Worked on implementing **alternative encoding methods** (e.g., binary and TF-IDF encoding) for comparative analysis.
- Configured and ran the **Gradient Boosting Classifier** on datasets with alternative encodings.
- Performed **comparative analysis** on model performance across different encoding techniques, focusing on precision and accuracy.
- Contributed to **documentation and presentation** of findings, highlighting key insights from the comparative results.

## Outcome
The analysis determined that **k-mer encoding** was the most effective approach, achieving a mean average precision of **0.522** and an F1-score of **0.383**. This finding underscored the potential of k-mer encoding as an effective feature extraction method for DNA sequence classification, providing a foundation for further research in genomics applications.
