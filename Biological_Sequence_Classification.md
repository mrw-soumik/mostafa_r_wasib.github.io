# Biological Sequence Classification via Data Encoding

**Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, Gradient Boosting  

## Objective
To explore and determine the most effective data encoding method for classifying biological sequences, contributing to better understanding and classification in genomics research.

## Key Contributions
- Conducted detailed data analysis to test different encoding methods, including k-mer, binary, and TF-IDF encoding.
- Applied Gradient Boosting Classifier to evaluate model performance with each encoding method.
- Analyzed and documented the impact of each encoding on classification accuracy and precision.

## Outcome
Found that k-mer encoding was most effective, achieving a mean average precision of 0.522 and an F1-score of 0.383. This result highlighted k-mer encoding as an effective feature extraction method for biological sequence classification.
