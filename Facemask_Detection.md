# Industrial Machine Vision - Facemask Detection System

**Technologies:** MATLAB, Image Processing Toolbox  

## Objective
To develop an industrial vision system that detects the presence of face masks in real-time, enhancing safety compliance monitoring.

## Key Contributions
- Implemented pre-processing steps such as image smoothing and histogram equalization for clear feature extraction.
- Applied color segmentation and contour detection to identify mask presence and classify face images.
- Utilized morphological operations to improve the accuracy and robustness of detection under varied conditions.

## Outcome
Delivered a functional face mask detection system with moderate accuracy, meeting industry requirements for real-time monitoring and safety compliance.
