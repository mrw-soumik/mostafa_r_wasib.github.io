# Neural Network for Image Classification

**Technologies:** Python, Keras  

## Objective
To build a simple neural network that classifies images into categories, providing foundational experience with deep learning.

## Key Contributions
- Designed a feed-forward neural network using Keras to classify images from the MNIST dataset.
- Preprocessed the image data, normalizing pixel values to enhance model training.
- Evaluated model accuracy and improved performance by tuning hyperparameters.

## Outcome
Achieved over 90% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating basic neural network implementation skills in image classification.
