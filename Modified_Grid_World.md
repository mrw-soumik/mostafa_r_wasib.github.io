# Learning Policies in a Modified Grid World Environment

**Technologies:** Python  

## Objective
To apply and analyze reinforcement learning algorithms in a modified grid world environment, focusing on policy optimization and evaluation in episodic tasks.

## Key Contributions
- Implemented and evaluated multiple algorithms including:
  - Solving the system of Bellman equations for exact policy evaluation.
  - Iterative Policy Evaluation and Value Iteration to determine the optimal policy.
- Experimented with Monte Carlo methods with and without exploring starts in a dynamic environment with probabilistic transitions.
- Applied an epsilon-soft approach to learn optimal policies with exploration in an episodic setting.

## Outcome
The Monte Carlo method with exploring starts provided stable results in the dynamic grid world environment. Policy iteration with value iteration yielded the optimal policy under changing conditions, demonstrating the efficacy of Monte Carlo and TD learning in reinforcement learning tasks.
