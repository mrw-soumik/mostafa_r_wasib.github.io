# Functional and Logic Programming - Scheduling System in Prolog

**Technologies:** Prolog  

## Objective
To create a scheduling system that produces optimal schedules based on time and resource constraints.

## Key Contributions
- Built a constraint-based scheduling system using Prolog, setting rules for time slots, resources, and activities.
- Designed an interface where users input constraints, and the system outputs a feasible schedule.
- Leveraged Prologâ€™s backtracking feature to find solutions that satisfy multiple constraints.

## Outcome
The system generated optimal schedules efficiently, showcasing the power of logic programming for constraint satisfaction problems.
